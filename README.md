# supersonic
A micro javascript framework built on React and Redux

** Not ready for production yet, still a major work in progress **

## Installation

Easy:
```bash
$ npm install -g supersonic
```

## Usage

### Create a new Supersonic app

```bash
$ ss new my-project-name
```

Supersonic will create a new project for you in a folder with the same name
as your chosen project name.

### Start the server

Go into your newly created project folder and run:
```bash
$ ss server
```

Visit `localhost:3000` and there's your app! If all went well you should just
see "Hello World"

Hack away!!!
